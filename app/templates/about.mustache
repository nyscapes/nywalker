<p class="lead"><code>NYWalker</code> is a distributed project that aims to
  collect data and develop a rich database of places mentioned in various
  novels. As the name suggests, the initial focus is on novels about New York
  City, but the code doesn’t particularly care about New York City. We do.</p>

<h2>Rationale</h2>

<p>As the geospatial Digital Humanities matures, a lot of the work being done
  on “space in literature,” as <a
    href="https://books.google.com/books?id=ja2MUXS_YQUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=moretti+space+in+literature&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjP17rHmqrJAhVG2xoKHZZHD3YQ6AEIHTAA#v=onepage&q=%22space%20in%20literature%22&f=false"
    target="_blank">Franco Moretti <span class="fa fa-external-link"
      aria-hidden="true"></span></a> refers to it, involves <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named-entity_recognition"
    target="_blank">named-entity recognition <span class="fa
      fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></a> of a giant dataset
  of novels.  See, for example, the <a href="http://txtgeo.net"
    target="_blank">Textual Geographies <span class="fa
      fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></a> project, which
  “presents, analyzes, and visualizes a collection of more than 5 billion named
  locations extracted from 5 million books and journals.”</p>

<p>We’re unsatisfied with the results available from that kind of analysis; it
  doesn’t answer the questions we have, as NER strips so much semantic (and
  probably more subjective) information away from each instance of a place
  mentioned in a text. <!--The <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/precision_and_recall"
    target="_blank">precision and recall <span class="fa
      fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>, also, we suspect is
  worse.-->
</p>

<p>Instead, this application relies on time-consuming hand entry for one object
  at a time, serving as an example of tiny digital humanities. The default
  setting is not any more semantically rich than what NER would return (simply,
  place name and position in text), but it is not terribly difficult to expand
  the <code>Instance</code> model to include, say, a boolean for whether the
  instance is inside dialog. Or part of a trip. Or to create a
  <code>Character</code> model who is responsible for that instance in the
  text.</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<p> We want to understand specific novels better. We can do that, we believe,
  in part by creating a (geospatial) database that is of use to us in
  answering questions about U.S. novels primarily related to New York City.
  But we also want this database to be available to the outside world, as well.
  It’s an idiosyncratic product, possibly recreating issues related to
  selection bias, canonization, and the rest. But it’s a start.  </p>

<p>
  In addition to the above research goals, we also use this application
  pedagogically. Entering data is part of the course requirements for the
  “Writing New York” course at New York University, and the software is also used
  in at least one version of NYU’s “Digital Literary Studies” course. We believe
  that it’s a lightweight point of entry into the (geospatial) digital
  humanities, providing both instant feedback (a map!) and also encouraging
  students to collaborate, act as detectives hunting down geographical data, and
  the rest.
</p>

<p>
  Finally, the work is public-facing, fulfilling a final pedagogical goal, of
  giving students the opportunity to work on research projects with “real-world”
  applications.

<h2>Citing <code>NYWalker</code></h2>

<p>
  <code>NYWalker</code> depends on the labor put into it by students, staff,
  and faculty. For more information on how to cite this data repository, please
  see the <a href="/citing">citing</a> page. This page is generated
  computationally, so it may take a while to load.
