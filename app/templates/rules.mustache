<h1>Instance Rules</h1>

<p class="lead">Entering a bunch of data by hand is better if it’s
  systematized, so here are a few tips for consistency. These are all judgment
  calls based on what seems to make data entry easiest.</p>

<p class="lead"><strong>When in doubt, encode it and flag it!</strong> We can always delete it later.</p>

<h2><em>Do</em> encode…</h2>

<h3>Made up places</h3>

<p>Every place in a novel is, in its own way, “made up” by the author, so they
  should all be encoded. For example, Skuytercliff, the Hudson
  River Valley estate of the van der Luydens, is most likely wholly
  Edith Wharton’s invention, and we cannot be even “mostly” sure of where it
  is, but it should still be encoded. When adding the place, just set the
  confidence to 0.</p>

<h3>Noun modifiers (“New York Times”)</h3>

<p>Unlike adjectives (see below), noun modifiers <strong>should</strong> be encoded. Here are a few examples:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Alençon</strong> lace and <strong>Waterford</strong> crystal. Both are named after their places of origin.</li>
    <li><em><strong>New York</strong> Times</em> (but not <em><strong>New York</strong>er Magazine</em>) </li>
    <li><strong>Kentucky</strong> Derby (but do not add a reference to Churchill Downs)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>However, if the noun modifier is part of a specific place that can be identified, then the whole entity counts as one instance:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>New York University</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Boston Garden</strong></li>
    <li><strong>London Bridge</strong></li>
  </ul>

<h3>Enclosing places (“Manhattan, New York”) and other doubling and addresses</h3>

<p>Places given as a set of enclosing objects (like an address, which in
  English moves from small to larger geographical entity) have <strong>each
    specific place</strong> encoded. “Manhattan, New York,” then, is a
  reference both to <strong>Manhattan</strong> and to <strong>New York
    (state)</strong>. More precisely, it is <strong>two separate
    instances</strong>. Neither instance, however, is a reference to New York
  City.</p>

<p>There is at least one exception to this rule. For convenience, “Washington, D.C.”
  is a <strong>single instance of “Washington, D.C.”</strong> and not two
  separate references to Washington (the city) and the District of Columbia.</p>

<p>On the other hand, an expression like “please go to Sana’a Deli at 31
  Rivington Street” <em>is two</em> instances, once for <strong>Sana’a
    Deli</strong> and once for <strong>31 Rivington St. NYC</strong>, though
  they are both references to <em>the same place</em>. Note, however, that
  there is <em>no reference</em> here to Rivington St. by itself.</p>

<h3>Places as genitives (“University of Chicago”)</h3>

<p>When the place is a genitive (“<em>n</em> of <strong>place</strong>”), then
  it is a <strong>single instance</strong>, either to the place
  mentioned, or to the entity as a whole. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>University of Chicago</strong></li>
  <li><strong>University of California - Davis</strong> (not 2 or 3 separate instances)</li>
  <li>shores of the <strong>Atlantic</strong></li>
  <li>smells of <strong>Paris</strong></li>
  <li>easternmost district of <strong>Mirzapur</strong></li>
  <li><strong>North Side of Chicago</strong> [note capitals!]</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>But…</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Lucknow</strong> is considered the <strong>Paris</strong> of <strong>India</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>“Paris of India” could conceivably be an <em>alternate name</em> for Lucknow, but it makes more sense semantically as references to two specific places.</p>

<h3>Possessives (“Sardi’s”)</h3>

<p>Clearly, “We had lunch at <strong>Sardi’s</strong>” or “We went out for <strong>Mamoun’s Falafel</strong>” should be encoded. But what about “We went to Sandy’s apartment”? Because of the lack of the capital, it should <strong>not</strong> be encoded. <strong>However</strong>, “we told him we were at <strong>Sandy’s</strong>” <strong>should</strong>, because it is equivalent to Sardi’s above.</p>

<h3>Corners (“82nd and Park”)</h3>

<p>Corners should be found on the map and marked clearly as one instance, not
  two (one of each street). Conversely, a sentence like “She stood on Park between
  82nd and 83rd” would be three different instances.</p>

<h3>Metonymy (“Wall Street,” “Hollywood”)</h3>

<p>Often, if not usually, a term like “Wall Street” is not a reference to the
  specific, short street in downtown Manhattan but is, rather, a reference to
  the entire financial industry, including people scattered around the world.
  This is an instance of metonymy, and it is to be encoded. That little street
  holds a lot of semantic weight that it has accrued over time, but it has
  carried it well, and can continue to do so.</p>

<h3>Personal names (“Indiana Jones,” “<em>U.S.S. Arizona</em>”)</h3>

  <p>These are sometimes encoded and sometimes not. See below.</p>

<h2>Do <em>not</em> encode…</h2>

<h3>Places that are not capitalized (“the park,” “the ocean”)</h3>

<p>Generally, if a place is not capitalized, you do not encode it, even though
  you know the park is Central Park or the ocean is the Atlantic. On the other
  hand, “he led her to the Park” would be encoded, if you can make a good guess
  as to what park it is. Do not hurry to assume, though.</p>

<p>Hence, a reference to a place like “north <strong>India</strong>” would be a
  reference to India, but not to a new place called “North India.” The same
  holds true for “north side of <strong>Chicago</strong>.” But capitalization
  is key, because “<strong>North Side of Chicago</strong>” <strong>is</strong>
  separate from just Chicago</p>

<h3>Adjectives and demonyms (“French”)</h3>

<p>Adjectives, such as “French,” “American,” or “English” are <strong>not</strong> to be encoded. The same goes for languages based on the adjectives and for demonyms (such as “Spaniard”).</p>


<h3>Workplaces, leisure (“Sotheby’s,” “the Opera”)</h3>

<p>These are a bit of a gray area. Because Sotheby’s has multiple locations,
  “she works at Sotheby’s” should <strong>not</strong> be encoded. However, “he
  works at the McDonald’s on Broadway” should
  be encoded twice, once as the <strong>McDonald’s (Washington Pl. &amp;
    Broadway)</strong> and once for <strong>Broadway</strong> (but see “Corners,” above).</p>

<p>Similarly tricky is how the word “Opera” is used in a novel like <i>Age of
    Innocence</i>. First, it is a “nickname” of the Academy of Music, which was
  located at 14th and Irving Place. So in a sentence like “To come to the Opera
  in a Brown <em>coupé</em> was almost as honourable a way of arriving as in
  one’s own carriage,” we encode for the <strong>Academy of Music</strong>. On
  the other hand, a sentence like “in metropolises it was ‘not the thing’ to
  arrive early at the Opera” would not, typically be encoded (“Opera” is always
  capitalized in that novel. This is not easy!</p>


<h3>Personal names (“Indiana Jones,” “<em>U.S.S. Arizona</em>”)</h3>

<p>Personal names that have a geographical resonance should <em>not</em> be
  encoded unless the name is tied to a specific location, like in a title (“the
  Duke of <strong>York</strong>”) or in a nickname (“<strong>Pecos</strong>
  Bill”). An exception can be made if it is clear in the work that the place
  was important in naming the person, as in <em>Joy Luck Club</em>, where
  Waverly is named after the street the family was living on when she was born.</p>

<p>Toponyms affixed to things like boats, however, should be noted, as they are
  clearly named with the place in mind.</p>
