<h1>Instance Rules</h1>

<p class="lead">Entering a bunch of data by hand is better if it’s
  systematized, so here are a few tips for consistency. These are all judgment
  calls based on what seems to make data entry easiest.</p>

<p class="lead"><strong>When in doubt, encode it and flag it!</strong> We can always delete it later.</p>

<h2>Places that are not capitalized (“the park,” “the ocean”)</h2>

<p>Generally, if a place is not capitalized, you do not encode it, even though
  you know the park is Central Park or the ocean is the Atlantic. On the other
  hand, “he led her to the Park” would be encoded, if you can make a good guess
  as to what park it is. Do not hurry to assume, though.</p>

<p>That said, per-novel exceptions are sometimes warranted, such as the use of
  “downtown” in <em>Let the Great World Spin</em>, because every use of the
  word is a clear indication of Downtown Manhattan, but McCann chose not to
  capitalize it.</p>

<h2>Adjectives and demonyms (“French”)</h2>

<p>Adjectives, such as “French,” “American,” or “English” are <strong>not</strong> to be encoded. The same goes for languages based on the adjectives and for demonyms (such as “Spaniard”).</p>

<h2>Noun modifiers (“New York Times”)</h2>

<p>Conversely to adjectives, noun modifiers <strong>should</strong> be encoded. Here are a few examples:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Alençon</strong> lace and <strong>Waterford</strong> crystal. Both are named after their places of origin.</li>
    <li><em><strong>New York</strong> Times</em> (but not <em><strong>New York</strong>er Magazine</em>) </li>
    <li><strong>Kentucky</strong> Derby (but do not add a reference to Churchill Downs)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>However, if the noun modifier is part of a specific place that can be identified, then the whole entity counts as one instance:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>New York University</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Boston Garden</strong></li>
    <li><strong>London Bridge</strong></li>
  </ul>

<h2>Enclosing places (“Manhattan, New York”)</h2>

<p>Places given as a set of enclosing objects (like an address, which in
  English moves from small to larger geographical entity) have <strong>each
    specific place</strong> encoded. “Manhattan, New York,” then, is a
  reference both to <strong>Manhattan</strong> and to <strong>New York (state)</strong>. More precisely, it
  is <strong>two separate instances</strong>. Neither instance, however, is a
  reference to New York City.</p>

<p>There is at least one exception to this rule. For convenience, “Washington, D.C.”
  is a <strong>single instance of “Washington, D.C.”</strong> and not two
  separate references to Washington (the city) and the District of Columbia.</p>

<h2>Places as genitives (“University of Chicago”)</h2>

<p>When the place is a genitive (“<em>n</em> of <strong>place</strong>), then
  it is a <strong>single instance</strong>, either to the place
  mentioned, or to the entity as a whole. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>University of Chicago</strong></li>
  <li><strong>University of California - Davis</strong> (not 2 or 3 separate instances)</li>
  <li>shores of the <strong>Atlantic</strong></li>
  <li>smells of <strong>Paris</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2>Workplaces, leisure (“Sotheby’s,” “the Opera”)</h2>

<p>These are a bit of a gray area. Because Sotheby’s has multiple locations,
  “she works at Sotheby’s” should <strong>not</strong> be encoded. However, “he
  works at the McDonald’s on Broadway” should
  be encoded twice, once as the <strong>McDonald’s (Washington Pl. &amp;
    Broadway)</strong> and once for <strong>Broadway</strong> (but see “Corners,” below).</p>

<p>Similarly tricky is how the word “Opera” is used in a novel like <i>Age of
    Innocence</i>. First, it is a “nickname” of the Academy of Music, which was
  located at 14th and Irving Place. So in a sentence like “he walked toward the
  Opera,” we encode for the <strong>Academy of Music</strong>. On the other hand, a sentence
  like “she loved the Opera” would not, typically be encoded (“Opera” is always
  capitalized in that novel. This is not easy!</p>

<h2>Corners (“82nd and Park”)</h2>

<p>Corners should be found on the map and marked clearly as one instance, not
  two (one of each street). Conversely, a sentence like “She stood on Park between
  82nd and 83rd” would be three different instances.</p>
