# NYWalker-Server [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nyscapes/nywalker-server.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/nyscapes/nywalker-server) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/nyscapes/nywalker-server.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/nyscapes/nywalker-server) [![Inline docs](http://inch-ci.org/github/nyscapes/nywalker-server.svg)](http://inch-ci.org/github/nyscapes/nywalker-server) 

`NYWalker-Server` is a distributed project that aims to develop a rich database of
places mentioned in various novels. As the name suggests, the initial focus is
on novels about New York City, but the code doesn’t particularly care about New
York City. We do.

## Forking, contributing, etc.

NYWalker can be used for just one novel, of course, and that was how it was
originally conceived (back when it was merely [a literary atlas of John Dos
Passos’s *U.S.A.*](http://github.com/muziejus/usa-atlas)). As such, it is
provided in an abstract enough form to encourage forking and letting users to
roll their own databases for use by the scholarly community. We only ask that
you let us know if you create a similar project. Who knows, maybe we’ll make
use of your databases in the future.

Unfortunately, because the database is a PostGIS one, forking is not as simple
as providing a Heroku “deploy” button. Stay tuned for updates to this, though…

We obviously also welcome pull requests.

## Who are we?

This application is listed in GitHub under the
[NewYorkScapes](http://newyorkscapes.org) collective, but (for now) it
represents mostly the work of [Moacir P. de Sá Pereira](http://moacir.com), of
NYU’s [English Department](http://english.fas.nyu.edu). [Prof. Tom
Augst](http://english.fas.nyu.edu/object/ThomasAugst.html) has also consulted
on it, and he has also helped make the resources available for the
project to come to fruition. The live version of the site is hosted by the [FAS
Office of Educational Technology](https://wp.nyu.edu/fas-edtech) at NYU. It is
also part of the [#NYUDH](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23nyudh&src=typd)
network.
